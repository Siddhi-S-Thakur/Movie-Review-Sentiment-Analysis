don't watch this. personally i really disliked the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired straight from the street. the dialogs are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next. the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget. when we saw this movie (me and 3 other people) we all had in mind, that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this, just to get their graduation at a film school - with the lowest effort. another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone.\",\n          \"gunga din (1939) is based on rudyard kipling's poem.the movie is directed by george stevens.it's set in india during the 19th century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous cult.gunga din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling moments.the three leading men are brilliant.cary grant is sgt.archibald cutter, victor mclaglen is sgt.'mac' macchesney and douglas fairbanks jr.(the son of the legendary you know who) is sgt.thomas ballantine.let's not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant way.the beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline stebbins.it's awfully fun to watch the difficulties of tommy's and emmy's wedding plans.gunga din is awfully lot of fun.it can be funny, it can be thrilling.it can be everything a good movie requires.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
